# Pytorch Transformer Minimal Examples

## Sequence classification

We use the transformer-encoder to classify between 3 artificial "languages" as either a sequence (of symbols) or a timeseries (of floating point numbers). For more info, see this [README](./sequence_classification/README.md).

## Sequence generation

We use the transformer-decoder to complete sentences (as a sequence of characters) based on the works of Shakespeare. For more info, see this [README](./sequence_generation/README.md).

## timeseries_generation

Use the transformer-decoder to predict the future temperature from weather data. For more info, see this [README](./timeseries_generation/README.md).

## image_classification

Predict the written name (annotation) of a number based on an image. For more info, see this [README](./sequence_image_classification/README.md).
