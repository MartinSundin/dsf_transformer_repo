# Pytorch Transformer Minimal Examples

## Sequence classification

We use the transformer-encoder to classify between 3 artificial "languages" as either a sequence (of symbols) or a timeseries (of floating point numbers).

## Sequence generation

We use the transformer-decoder to complete sentences (as a sequence of characters) based on the works of Shakespeare.

## timeseries_generation

Use the transformer-decoder to predict the future temperature from weather data.

## image_classification

Predict the written name of a number based on an image.
